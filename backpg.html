<h4>Pele</h4>
<h6 class="para">There’s always debate about who’s the greatest football player of all time. Pele was the first to be unanimously
 awarded that title and those who’ve seen him play call him the finest ever.<br>
 For starters, he is the only player in the world to win 3 FIFA World Cups. He burst onto the scene in the 1958 World 
 Cup as a 17-year old and was instrumental in his country’s first World Cup win. Two more titles followed in 1962 and 1970, with Pele being adjudged the best player at the 1970 World Cup. Not to forget, that the 1970 World Cup winning side is considered to be the best international football team.

In addition to his stupendous skill with the ball, Pele was a feared goal-scorer as his record shows. According to 
International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS), Pele scored 1281 goals in 1363 games at the club-level.
 He is still Brazil’s all-time leading scorer despite the country producing some great attacking talents like Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Neymar.

Pele’s stardom coincided with FIFA expanding the sport greatly and the Brazilian became a global megastar. ‘The Black Pearl’ 
served as a global ambassador for the sport and his teams used to tour multiple international locations to play friendly games. After his retirement in 1977, Pele also appeared in a Hollywood film Escape To Victory alongside Sylvester Stallone, Michael Caine and fellow football player, Bobby Moore.

Despite never playing for a European club, Pele’s legacy remains as strong as ever. For all of the modern football greats,
 he is the ghost to chase as the dreams of emulating him reverberate in every football player on the planet.

<h4>Messi</h4>
<h6 class="para">
There have been many Argentine players with the mantle of ‘The Next Maradona’. Pablo Aimar, Alessandro D’Alessandro, 
Ariel Ortega and many others. None of them lived up to that title.<br>

Lionel Messi, arguably, has surpassed that title and the man himself.<br>
Born in Rosario, Messi’s footballing career started at Newell’s Old Boys before he was snapped up by FC Barcelona.
 At the Catalan club, Messi became the legend that he is today winning everything at club level and serving as the 
 club’s talisman.

With FC Barcelona, Messi has won nine La Liga titles, six Copa del Rey’s and three UEFA Champions League titles.
 He is also FC Barcelona’s all-time leading goal-scorer as well as assist provider. A record that he also holds 
 for La Liga. In the 2011-12 season, Messi scored 50 goals in La Liga, which is the highest ever in a single season.
 In 2012, he scored 93 goals which was the highest ever in a calendar year in the top football leagues. He has also 
 won the European Golden Shoe five times along with the Pichichi trophy. Not to mention his stranglehold on the Ballon
 D’Or with Messi winning the award five times.

While his critics argue that Messi has not had international success, he has led Argentina through a fairly successful
 period. Messi led the team to the 2014 World Cup final and was also adjudged the tournament’s best player. He also 
 captained the team to two successive Copa America finals appearances in 2015 and 2016, which ended up in losses to Chile.

Messi is a global star and is one of the most recognizable sportspersons in the world. His rivalry with Cristiano
 Ronaldo has drawn comparisons to famous sports rivalries like Borg-McEnroe, Prost-Senna, Federer-Nadal and more.
 He is easily one of the greatest legends of the sport.

<h4>Ronaldo</h4>
<h6 class="para">
From Messi to his greatest on-field rival, Cristiano Ronaldo.<br>

It is very interesting that both Messi and Ronaldo emerged as stars at roughly the same time. 
But there’s no denying that both of them have changed the landscape of football with their jaw-dropping
 talent and of course, records.
<br>
The Portuguese superstar started his career at Sporting Lisbon but achieved worldwide fame with Manchester United
 where he went on to win three Premier League titles and an FA Cup. He also won his first UEFA Champions League with
 them, winning it in the 2007-08 season. In 2008, he also received the first of his five Ballon D’Ors.

In 2009, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in what was then, a world record transfer fee. He developed into a goal-machine 
at the Santiago Bernabeu, becoming Real Madrid’s all-time leading goalscorer in a stint that lasted nine years. In 
addition to that, he also set the record for most La Liga hat-tricks and won the Pichichi trophy thrice. Ronaldo 
also was Los Blancos’ best player when they won the league title in 2011-12 and 2016-17.

Ronaldo’s performance in the Champions League was of even greater proportions as he is the first man to win
 the prestigious trophy five times. Ronaldo is the highest goal-scorer in the competition’s history and finished 
 as top-scorer in a single tournament, five times.

While he may not have the same number of League titles as his rival Messi, Ronaldo has an international trophy 
to his name, leading Portugal to victory at the 2016 European Championships. He is also the most capped player for 
Portugal and the country’s leading goal-scorer. Furthermore, he is the only player to score a goal in eight consecutive 
international tournaments.

Ronaldo moved to Italian giants Juventus in 2019 and the £104 Million fee was the highest for a player above the age 
of 30. It was also the highest fee paid by a Serie A club in history.

Ronaldo is, as per ESPN, the world’s most famous sportsperson. According to Forbes, he’s the highest paid football 
player and the most marketable athlete in the world. A true legend of the game.
